/*
 * This class handles calls to draw the PlayerDummy object (except not really.)
 * 
 * When doRender() is called, we don't draw anything for the dummy itself.
 * Instead, we prepare some things, then call a vanilla player renderer at a very precise position relative to the camera.
 * 
 * In other words: The original doRender() call is *indirectly* triggering a vanilla player render operation,
 * instead of rendering our dummy entity (which is invisible anyway).
 * 
 * Using the vanilla renderer means we will automatically inherit any changes *other* mods have made to the player character,
 * but it also means that we have to deal with anything they add to the head that could block the view.
